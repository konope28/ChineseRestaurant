# ChineseRestaurant
# This is a project that I made during my bachelor studies.
# It simulates the operation of a restaurant and gathers some statistical data about average time spent in queues and average length of these queues.
# All parameters e.g. number of cashiers, waiters etc. may be set inside main.cpp.
# Pseudo-random generators need some kernels to operate. Kernels are stored inside kernels.txt and if needed may be generated inside the program.
